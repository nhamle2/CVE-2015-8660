<h1>2015-8660 Research</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This is research I conducted on the CVE 2015-8660 overlayFS vulnerability for my Operating System Security course final research project. The goal of this project was to find a Linux kernel vulnerability from 2012-2022, explain the vulnerability, it's potential effects, and present a demo using an exploit. This vulenerability is caused by the ovl_setattr funtion located in the fs/overlayfs/inode.c program. When exploited via a crafted application, a malicious user will be able to gain privileged access to a loca machine. This vulnerability affects linux kernel versions through 4.3.3. My project research paper is included as well as a video of a demo presentation using exploitation code found on Exploit-db, which is also referenced below.
